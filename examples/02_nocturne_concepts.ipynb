    "\n",
    "- Nocturne simulations are **discretized traffic scenarios**. A scenario is a constructed snapshot of traffic situation at a particular timepoint.\n",
    "- The state of the vehicle of focus is referred to as the **ego state**. Each vehicle has their **own partial view of the traffic scene**; and a visible state is constructed by parameterizing the view distance, head angle and cone radius of the driver. The action for each vehicle is a `(1, 3)` tuple with the acceleration, steering and head angle of the vehicle. \n",
    "- The **step method advances the simulation** with a desired step size. By default, the dynamics of vehicles are driven by a kinematic bicycle model. If a vehicle is set to expert-controlled mode, its position, heading, and speed will be updated according to a trajectory recorded from a human driver."
